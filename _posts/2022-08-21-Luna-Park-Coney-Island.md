Coney’s Cones and Paul’s Daughter are two shops with tempting treats that stand guard on either side of Luna Park’s ticket booth and entrance. The entrance faces the boardwalk and the Atlantic Ocean, offering an exciting view of the horizon filled with rapidly changing clouds, soothing waves and seagulls hunting for their next meal.

The entrance is relatively short, with blue columns and beams that divide the front into three equal gates. The gates are made up of silver painted rolling shutters and are perforated to allow a peek into the amusement park. The orange ticket booth with a blue roof sit in the middle, right in front of the rolling shutter, and the crescent moon-shaped lights adorn the top of this facade and red flower-shaped lights inscribed within the moon. The entrance, with its bright colors and the illuminated crescent moon concertizes the electric atmosphere, looking almost like a children’s classic book cover.

As the crowd waits patiently in a queue to buy their tickets, the entrance hints at what comes next. The Carousel, the Steeplechase, and the Ferris wheel, along with the games arcade, call out to everyone in line to buy their tickets. Coney’s cones selling gelato and Paul’s Daughter selling fries and cotton candy add to this melange, making it almost impossible to wait. As the air fills with excitement, everyone is invited to join the dream, just like sailors to the song of sirens.
