A solitary sign with pink footprints is painted on the sidewalk near the entrance to 256 Ashland Place. The footprints are symbolic and look very similar to shoe prints of a toddler. A small instruction underneath them reads ‘Please wait here.’ The bright pink on the dark color of the sidewalk makes a striking impression as the soft hue of the sign meets the contrasting concrete.

The feet in the sign point toward the entrance door yet continue to stay in their place, unquestioningly following the instructions to wait there. Bound to the exact location where they were originally placed and wondering when they get their turn to enter the building.
