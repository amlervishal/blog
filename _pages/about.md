Innovation and knowledge have been the key driving force for the last 12 years as I gained a substantial part of my work experience working with relentless mentors who taught me there is always more to learn. The work experience I gained in the past years reflects the diversity of roles I could perform in various offices.

My experience involves working with reputed firms in India, such as RSP, a Singapore-based design Studio, Abaxial Architects, a small bespoke design studio & GEMS Education, one of the largest K-12 education providers across the world. Each required a different skill-set. At Abaxial and RSP, I gained creative design and production drawings skills, while GEMS education provided an opportunity to lead the client-side design management.

I consider my strengths to be problem-solving, decision-making, and integrity. I am a fast learner and always open to new challenges. Creativity is one of my strongest suit. I am currently seeking an opportunity in the AEC industry.
